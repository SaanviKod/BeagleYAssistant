# Designing a Smart Assistant with Beagle-Y-AI
### By: Saanvi Kodiganti

In order to demonstrate the out of the box experience and feature capabilities of the BeagleY-AI, a Google AIY Voice Kit designed for the Raspberry Pi 4 will be adapted for it. This kit outlines instructions on how to develop a makeshift voice assistant; where a person can speak, the device looks up a response to the prompt, and then outputs this response. However, the provided project uses the google-assistant-library python module, which is now deprecated. OpenAI will be used as an alternate model. More information on how to implement it can be found at INSERT LINK HERE.
